    "bio":"I've done many things since leaving school, yet I've never found something which satifies my drive for problem solving and being creative. Recently completing a Physics degree with The Open University taught me that I crave learning new things and consistenly challenging myself. Problem solving is what I'm meant to be doing. The School of Code has given me the chance to propel myself into a career which feels like a match made in heaven.",

I had never worked in the travel industry before and straight away Craig made me feel welcome and helped ease me into a new sector. His managerial skills are second to none. He understands and listens to everything he is told and uses his vast knowledge on how to maybe change the smallest of things for the biggest difference. I have worked with many managers during my career and have never come across anyone with his level of understanding, knowledge, and compassion. his willingness to learn and improve his skill set means he is the ideal candidate for any role",

Not only is he everything you would want in your team, hardworking, committed and driven, I have witnessed first hand how he uses his passion and energy to create new teams, drive results and truly lead by example. Craig has an intelligent mindset and an amazing ability to interpret complex tasks / projects and position them in simpler terms to help understanding and gain buy-in from those around him. Wherever Craig goes next, I am confident he will be a great success and you will be very lucky to have him as part of your team",
